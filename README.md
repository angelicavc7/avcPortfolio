## Usage

- in the portfolio you have the nav bar that can take you to each ot the sections in that that same following order vertically
- the projects are then labeled with the name on each of them 
- their are 5 projects in total with only images, for projects to be later placed inside


## directions

## updated portfolio 2
-new directions, I updated the projects and added the opacity to the images.
-I reassigned ID names in the html document in order to make it easier to create flex boxes and make the tables align correctly.
- I also added the links of each of my projects into the images themselves and placed the files correctly into the image projects.
- I also placed all 4 projects together inline and added a new border to them.
-4 of the projects are populated with turned in assignments and links in them.
